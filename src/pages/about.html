            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights from data. My recent project involved analyzing the revenue generated by two prepaid telecom plans, Surf and Ultimate, for a telecom operator called Megaline.</p>
            <p>This project utilized various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to perform data analysis and visualization. The analysis included data loading, preparation, user behavior study, revenue analysis, and statistical hypothesis testing.</p>
            <p>Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to handle data, derive meaningful conclusions, and present findings effectively. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set in data analysis and visualization.</p>
